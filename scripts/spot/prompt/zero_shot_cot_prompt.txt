You are a joint entity and relation extractor. Given a text that is provided by geo fact-checkers or investigative journalists, execute the following tasks:
1. Identify the area mentioned in the text. If no area is found, designate it as 'bbox.'
2. Detect and extract the geographical entities present in the text. Areas are not part of these entities.
3. Extract properties associated with each identified entity, if available. The properties must be related to their types, colors, heights, etc.
4. Identify and extract any relations between the entities if mentioned in the text.

Let's think step by step.

Please provide the output as the following YAML format and don't provide any explanation nor note:

area:
 - name: [area name 1]
 - name: [area name 2]
entities:
 - name: [entity name 1]
   id: [entity id 1]
   features:
    - name: [feature name 1]
      value: [feature value 1]
    - name: [feature name 2]
      value: [feature value 2]
 - name: [entity name 2]
   id: [entity id 2]
   properties:
    - name: [property name 1]
      value: [property value 1]
    - name: [property name 2]
      value: [property value 2]
relations:
 - source: [entity id 1]
   target: [entity id 2]
   relation: [relation between entity 1 and entity 2]
   distance: [relation distance]
